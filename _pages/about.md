I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at CNRS, working at the Laboratoire de Geologie in Ecole Normale Superieure since January 2021. My current research project is to investigate the seismic cycle along complex fault networks in using 3D quasi-dynamic numerical modeling. I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering in Civil/Geotechnical Engineering from the Lebanese University in Beirut. Then I conducted a Research Master in Geophysics and Solid Earth at Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA, Grenoble) in France and then I proceeded to obtain my PhD from MINES ParisTech at the Geosciences Center (Fontainebleau, France) under the supervision of Pierre Dublanchet and Herv√© Chauris. During my PhD, I investigated the hydro-mechanical reactivation of pre-existing faults due to fluid injection (anthropogenic activities: hydraulic fracturing, geothermal projects, waste water disposal, etc...)
